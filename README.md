# CODSOFT
"As part of my CodSoft Internship Task 1, I built a Python-based Chatbot that interacts with users, answers simple queries, and provides automated responses. This project introduced me to conversational AI concepts and enhanced my coding skills."

This is my **CodSoft Internship Task 2** project.  
Tic Tac Toe (AI vs Human)
It’s a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python where **you play against the computer (AI)**.  
The cool part? The AI is built in such a way that it **never loses** – either it wins 🏆 or the game ends in a draw 🤝.  
## ✨ What this project does
- You play as **X** and the AI plays as **O**.  
- The AI uses a strategy (Minimax algorithm) to always make the best possible move.  
- The board updates after every move, showing your move and then the AI’s move.  
- The game keeps going until:
  - You win (which is very hard 😅)  
  - AI wins  
  - Or it’s a draw
