# CODSOFT
"As part of my CodSoft Internship Task 1, I built a Python-based Chatbot that interacts with users, answers simple queries, and provides automated responses. This project introduced me to conversational AI concepts and enhanced my coding skills."

This is my **CodSoft Internship Task 2** project.  
Tic Tac Toe (AI vs Human)
It’s a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Python where **you play against the computer (AI)**.  
The cool part? The AI is built in such a way that it **never loses** – either it wins 🏆 or the game ends in a draw 🤝.  

This is my **CodSoft Intership Task 3**
🎬 Recommendation System 
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that gives movie and series recommendations.
You just run the script, enter your favorite movie or series, and it suggests similar titles from Marvel, DC, anime, and popular shows.
